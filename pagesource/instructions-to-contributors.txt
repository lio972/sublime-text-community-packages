To contribute to the documents on this site, you'll need to be a contributor to the package collection. If so, you'll be largely set. 

At the very root of the subversion tree, there is a directory called `sublimetextwiki`. This is the full content of the site. To edit, you'll need to;

  - check out the source code from `https://sublime-text-community-packages.googlecode.com/svn`
  - edit the site. 
  - commit changes back.
  
The site is set up to receive a callback every time the subversion repository changes, and this callback should refresh the site automatically. It may take 30 seconds or so for changes to appear -- more if you've committed something large like a screencast, so you may need to be a little patient.

Editing the site is just a matter of knowing the subversion structure. The page content is build in [Markdown][md]; all the page content is stored in `sublimetextwiki/pagesource`, and translated into html pages in `sublimetextwiki/pages`. 

Since markdown doesn't feature a nice way to link to other markdown documents, I've added one. Source content that looks like so:
  
    (\@page-name)
    
will be considered a link to another markdown page, and translated into a link to `page-name.html`.
