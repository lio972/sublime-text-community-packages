This is an implementation of the emacs kill ring, for Sublime Text.

Rather than explain the emacs kill ring, I'm assuming you're interested because you're moving from emacs, and already know what the kill ring is. 

To use it;

- ctrl+k is kill-line
- ctrl+y is yank
- ctrl+shift+y is yank-any (ie, choose from all the entries in the kill ring)
- ctrl+shift+k is the new mapping for singleSelection, which was previously mapped to ctrl+k
