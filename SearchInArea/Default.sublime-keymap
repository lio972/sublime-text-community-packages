Available modifiers are ctrl, alt, shift.

Lines of the form "key1,key2 bind" will trigger when key1 is pressed, then key2
is pressed.

For example:
<binding key="ctrl+x,ctrl+s" command="save"/>

New key bindings take effect as soon as you save this file, there's no need to
restart Sublime Text.

Also note that if the same key is bound twice, the last binding takes precedence
