Ceedling Plugin for Sublime Text Editor
=======================================

Ceedling - Ruby/Rake-Based Build System for C Projects
------------------------------------------------------
Ceedling is a build system for C projects that is an extension for Ruby's Rake (make-ish) build system. Ceedling is primarily targeted at Test-Driven Development in C and is designed to pull together CMock and Unity, two other awesome open-source projects that you can't live without if you are doing TDD in the C language. In order to spread the awesomeness around, Ceedling is an extensible contraption with a nice plugin mechanism.
