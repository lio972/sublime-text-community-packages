PasteColumn plugin

	Use this command to cut and paste whole columns. It's especially useful when working with the keyboard.
	
	If you had i.e. 10 selection cursors when cutting the column, you need 10 selection cursors to paste the column.
	
	In the example below, select the 1st column, press Ctrl+X, press End, and press Ctrl+Alt+V to execute PasteColumn. It lets you change this:
	
	ABC
	DEF
	GHI
	JKL
	MNO
	PQR
	STU
	VWX
	YZ1
	      
	to this:
	
	BCA
    EFD
    HIG
    KLJ
    NOM
    QRP
    TUS
    WXV
    Z1Y
