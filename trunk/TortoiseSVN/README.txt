TortoiseSVN is a plugin that basically adds key bindings for common operations of the TortoiseSVN GUI client for integrating SVN repository operations from within Sublime Text.

See the included [_Default.sublime-keymap_](http://sublime-text-community-packages.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/TortoiseSVN/Default.sublime-keymap) for the full list of bindings added with this plugin.

This plugin assumes that you have TortoiseSVN installed on your system prior to use.
