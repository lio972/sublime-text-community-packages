# Ceedling - Ruby/Rake-Based Build System for C Projects
[Ceedling](http://ceedling.sourceforge.net) is a build system for C projects that is an extension for Ruby's Rake (make-ish) build system. Ceedling is primarily targeted at Test-Driven Development in C and is designed to pull together [CMock](http://cmock.sourceforge.net) and [Unity](http://embunity.sourceforge.net), two other awesome open-source projects that you can't live without if you are doing TDD in the C language. In order to spread the awesomeness around, Ceedling is an extensible contraption with a nice plugin mechanism.
