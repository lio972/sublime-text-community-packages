Note that this plugin is only tested with version Sublime Text 1.x, and thus is NOT guaranteed to work with Sublime Text 2

This plugin duplicates the currently selected line. It handles multiple
selections (i.e. all lines with selections will be duplicated) and all
selections are preserved. Just press ctrl-d, and you're golden.

There is also an alternative version that comments out the duplicated lines.
Ctrl-shift-D will give you that one.

Any bug reports and/or suggestions will gladly be accepted at
