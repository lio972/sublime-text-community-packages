This is an implementation of the emacs kill ring, for Sublime Text.


To use it;

- ctrl+k is kill-line
- ctrl+y is yank
- ctrl+shift+y is yank-any (ie, choose from all the entries in the kill ring)
- ctrl+shift+k is the new mapping for singleSelection, which was previously mapped to ctrl+k

NB: yank-any is not working at the moment. It should be fixed soon.
