Issues:
    The regexes for the EX commands don't escape \t tab characters so you can't 
    just line.split('\t')
    
    The key value pairs sometimes do not have values, and are only separated by
    a \t if they do. Makes parsing somewhat more complicated.
    
    Theres more than one tag per symbol so a dict of {symbol:tag} not possible
    instead {symbol:[tag1, tag2, ...]} etc
