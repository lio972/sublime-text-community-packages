Hyperlinking Sublime Package, by Steve Cooper

This provides a simple hyperlinking facility. 

You use it like this; create a folder and add at least one file with a ".wiki" extension. Open a file up, and insert hyperlinks like this;

    visit the [Other File]
    
Place your cursor inside the "[Other File]" text and hit ctrl-alt-n (navigate). You'll be prompted to create the file, then it'll be opened up. You can use this to create a rudimentary wiki.
