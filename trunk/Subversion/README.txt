Describes the subversion status of the files you are editing. In order to run this, you need the command-line versions of subversion on your path. 

Get subversion from [tigris.org](http://subversion.tigris.org/getting.html#binary-packages)

Note that having tortoiseSVN is not enough; you need to be able to execute svn.exe from the command line.
