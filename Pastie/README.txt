Pastie plugin.

This plugin automates sending pastes to Pastie http://pastie.caboo.se/
Pastes are sent in a background thread so the command will not block sublime.

== Usage ==

ctrl+f12     => send paste
ctrl+alt+f12 => send private paste

== IRC Client Activation == 

Pastie is by default configured to activate Pidgin (win32api SetForegroundWindow) and then SendKeys the shortcut sequence for paste.

The IRC client activation is configurable though. It's just a matter of setting a few regexes to match your prefered IRC clients top level window and title text. eg "^#.*"

See instruction in the source ( pastie.py ). Be sure to temporarily disable posting pastes while testing IRC client activation.
